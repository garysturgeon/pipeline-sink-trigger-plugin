<div>
  <p>This trigger is primarily used for periodically (using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cron">cron</a>-like expression) scheduling a build 
  of the configured sink job if and only if the corresponding build pipeline graph is inactive, stable, and stale.</p>
  
  <p><b>Inactive:</b> None of the jobs that make up the nodes of the build pipeline graph are currently running, or scheduled in the build queue.</p>
  <p><b>Stable:</b> The last build (if present) for each job that make up the nodes of the build pipeline graph were successful. This rule can be relaxed
  by selecting the <b>Ignore non-successful upstream dependency builds</b> option (not recommended).</p>
  <p><b>Stale:</b> The last build of the sink job was prior to any of the build jobs that make up the nodes of the build pipeline graph.</p>
  
  <p>All rules must comply in order for a build of the sink job to be scheduled.</p>
